# Purpose of the election audit

The goal of this project is to determine which county is the most populous based on votes. In module 3, we learnt how to read csv files in Python and use our coding skills to execute the data. We had to look through the data file's four columns to find the one that contained all of the candidates and figure out how many votes each received. We wrote the results to a text file with a winner after calculating the total votes and percentage of the total. We're trying something similar but different in the module 3 challenge. This time, we'll look at the total votes and percentages for each county in the counties column to see which one is the largest.


# Overview of Project
A Colorado Board of Elections has requested to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
5. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
6. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

> ***County Votes:***

> - **Jefferson** county has `10.5%` total percentage with a total votes of **38,855**
> - **Denver** county has the `82.8%` total percentage with a total votes of **306,055**
> - **Arapahoe** county has `6.7%` total percentage with a total votes of **24,801**

> ***County with Largest Number of Votes:***

> - **Denver** county has the largest number total of **306,055**
> - In addition, **Denver** county has the total votes percentage of `82.8%`  
> - **Denver** county is the Largest County Turnout

> ***Candidate Percentage of Votes:***
> - **Charles Casper Stockham** candidate has `23.0%` total percentage with a total votes of **85,213**
> - **Diana DeGette** candidate has the `73.8%` total percentage with a total votes of **272,892**
> - **Raymon Anthony Doane** candidate has `3.1%` total percentage with a total votes of **11,606**

> ***Election Results:***

> - In addition, **Diana DeGette** has the total percentage votes of `73.8%
> - **Diana DeGette** is the Winner

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
You could miss some creative methods to look at the data while learning Python, examining the code, and constructing a solid script for analysis. Engineering and data analysis must be balanced.
